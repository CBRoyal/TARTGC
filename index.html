            <p>Now as you may know right now to this point, The Amazing Race involves a lot of 
                physicality that includes running &amp; scrambling to different locations, and the 
                physical challenges that are presented on The Amazing Race. Here are some 
                guidelines to help train your body for The Amazing Race:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get into aerobic exercises like walking, running, swimming, balancing, 
                    climbing, and biking to increase your physicality and cardio endurance.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Run with your backpack with necessary stuff in it or a weighted vest 
                    to increase your endurance to really push your body forward.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Get into strength training exercises like lifting weights, 
                    squating, pull-ups, and press exercises to increase your strength endurance.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Include stretching exercises in your routine like yoga, plank poses, 
                    downward facing dog poses, and warrior poses to increase the flexibility of 
                    your body.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Run a rope course with your race teammate to not only increase your 
                    physicality, flexibility, and cardio endurance; but to also increase 
                    teamwork with your partner.</li>
            </ul><br><br>
            <!--Section that discusses the dancing challenges of The Amazing Race.-->
            <h2>Dancing Challenges</h2>

            <p>Dance challenges on the race are one of the toughest types of challenges there
               is on The Amazing Race, especially if you don't have dancing experience. But 
               not to worry as long as you watch and learn from the dance challenges from the 
               show, and practice them yourself with great muscle memory, technique, and 
               choreography; you'll be able to just glide through those dancing challenges in 
               no time.</p>

        <!--Section that discusses preparation for the mental challenges of The Amazing Race.-->
        <section id="the_amazing_race_travel_guide_mental_challenge_section">            
            <h2>Preparation for Mental Challenges</h2>
            <img src="./The Amazing Race Travel Guide_ How to Prepare For The Amazing Race&#39;s Challenges_files/ar-5.jpg" alt="Record Challenge" width="300" height="200">
            <p>Now The Amazing Race isn't just about the physicality, but it's also about the
               mentality as well. You need to be able to handle running the race under stress 
               and pressure; have a good memory for memory challenges, and a strong attention 
               to detail for detailed challenges. Here are some guidelines to help you train 
               your mind for The Amazing Race:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn how to drive a manual car because in some countries, they only drive 
                    stick-shift vehicles. So, I would recommend you practice driving a 
                    stick-shift car to prepare yourself for any stick-shift self-driving parts 
                    on the show.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Try assembling furniture regularly so that way, you're prepared for any 
                    assembly challenges on the race. This not only increases your skills to 
                    build something unfamiliar, but to reinforce reading directions.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Reinforce your attention to detail by keeping your environment space tidy 
                    and organized, getting into artistic and drawing skills, replicating 
                    a certain picture properly with every single detail and aspect in it, 
                    reading a book, creating lists, or practicing mindfulness exercises.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Get into meditation exercises to increase your mentality to stay calm 
                    under stressful and uncomfortable events.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Get into memory exercises, puzzles, and/or trivia to help reinforce your 
                    brain for the race.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Learn as many lanuages as possible on language-learning apps like Duolingo 
                    &amp; Babble</li>
                <br>
                <li>Learn how to read a map and navigate using only the map and not the GPS.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>* An important thing to keep in mind: The Amazing Race might be a race to get 
                 every task done as fast as possible, but the most important tip is to fully 
                 read the whole clue and do exactly what is says, as it is the #1 rule of 
                 The Amazing Race so just take your time, read the whole clue properly to 
                 understand the challenge you're on properly, and get all these Race tasks done
                 as efficiently as possible. Remember slow and steady wins the race.</p>
